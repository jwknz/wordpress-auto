# Wordpress setups

Below are a combination of scripts so you can easily setup a new Wordpress setup.  
Really just an easy way for me to start new projects as needed.

* Some of these are for a headless setup.
* Some of these use docker-compose

## Setup wordpress setup with it's own repo:

```
./setup-wp-git.sh ../dev-wp.env
./setup-wp-git.sh ../prod-wp.env
```

## Setup wordpress setup with it's own repo:

```
./setup-wp-plain.sh dev-wp.env
./setup-wp-plain.sh prod-wp.env
```
